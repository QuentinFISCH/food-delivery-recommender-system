## Context and motivations

This project was done for the Recommender Systems and Matrix Factorization (REMA) course at EPITA. The goal is to create a recommender system for a food delivery app.

## Work description

More precisely, the system needs to predict whether or not a customer at a certain location will order in a restaurant or not. This reduces the problem to a binary classification model.

Here, I used Neural Network Encoding method, which will learn the diverse features from each customers and vendors, to try and predict the best class. The input data has been purposefully degraded in order to make the problem harder, but I managed to get a F1 score of 74%, which can surely be beaten with more time on the board.
